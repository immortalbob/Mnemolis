# Backup & Restore

Mnemolis's entire persisted state lives in exactly five files, all under `/app/data` inside the container:

| File | What it holds |
|------|-----------------|
| `cache.json` | The [result cache](Caching#result-cache) |
| `routing_cache.json` | The [routing cache](Caching#routing-cache) |
| `query_log.db` | The query log — every request's timestamp, source, success, latency, and fallback flag |
| `snapshots.db` | [Snapshot history](Snapshot-Engine-and-Changes) for the background diff engine |
| `adversarial_testing.db` | [Adversarial self-testing](Adversarial-Self-Testing) combination history — synthetic generated queries only, never real user queries |

`GET /backup` tars all five into a downloadable `.tar.gz`. `GET /backup/info` shows what's currently in each file (size, last-modified time) without actually creating a backup — useful for a quick "is this worth backing up right now" check.

## What's deliberately *not* in the backup

Kiwix ZIM files, your `docker-compose.yml`, and `searxng/settings.yml` aren't included. `/backup` only covers Mnemolis's own internal state — back up your ZIM files and compose configuration separately, as part of your normal homelab backup routine. None of these four files would be useful to restore without the rest of your actual deployment configuration intact anyway.

## A real gotcha worth knowing before you need it: volume naming

Docker Compose automatically prefixes named volumes with your **project name**, which defaults to whatever folder `docker-compose.yml` lives in. A volume declared as `mnemolis_data` in your YAML doesn't actually get created with that exact name — if your folder is `minisearch/`, the real volume Docker creates is `minisearch_mnemolis_data`.

This matters specifically the moment you try to restore manually with `docker run -v`, because that command needs the *real* volume name, not the name written in the YAML. Always check first:

```bash
docker volume ls | grep data
# or, for a running container, the most direct check:
docker inspect mnemolis --format '{{json .Mounts}}' | python3 -m json.tool
```

`docker inspect` against the actual running container is the more reliable of the two — it shows you exactly which host path or named volume is genuinely mounted where, right now, rather than asking you to infer it from a list of volume names that might not obviously correspond to the right container.

If you want a stable, predictable volume prefix regardless of what the folder happens to be named, set it explicitly:

```bash
echo "COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=mnemolis" > .env
```

## Restoring

```bash
docker compose down

docker run --rm -v mnemolis_data:/app/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine \
  sh -c "cd /app/data && tar xzf /backup/mnemolis-backup.tar.gz"

docker compose up -d
```

Replace `mnemolis_data` in that command with whatever `docker volume ls` actually reported — not the bare name from `docker-compose.yml` — if you haven't set `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`.

## Why this volume-naming detail earned its own section

It's the kind of thing that looks like a Mnemolis bug the first time it bites someone — a restore command that silently does nothing, or appears to succeed while writing into a volume nothing's actually mounting — when the real cause is just Docker Compose's own naming convention being non-obvious. Worth checking the real volume name *before* assuming anything's broken, the same instinct that mattered when diagnosing [The SearXNG Timeout Lesson](The-SearXNG-Timeout-Lesson) — verify what's actually true on disk and in the running container before trusting what a config file or command *should* have done.
