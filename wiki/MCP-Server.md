# MCP Server

Mnemolis exposes everything through two interfaces at once: a REST API and an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, both backed by the exact same routing/decomposition/fusion logic underneath. The REST API is what Home Assistant and most automation scripts use; MCP is what lets Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any other MCP-aware client query Mnemolis directly as a tool.

## What's actually exposed

The MCP server exposes exactly **one tool**, called `search`, built with FastMCP's decorator-based registration:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def search(
    query: str,
    source: str = "auto",
    fusion_sources: list[str] | None = None,
) -> str:
    """Search across local and remote knowledge sources via Mnemolis. ..."""
```

This mirrors `POST /search`'s own request shape almost exactly — `query`, `source`, `fusion_sources` mean the same thing in both places, and the same [Routing](Routing), [Query Decomposition](Query-Decomposition), and [Conditional Query Detection](Conditional-Query-Detection) logic runs underneath regardless of which interface the call came through.

**A real, deliberate tradeoff worth knowing about:** `source` is typed as a plain `str`, not an `Enum`/`Literal`, even though the values are genuinely constrained to a fixed set (`auto`, `kiwix`, `forecast`, `news`, `web`, `uptime`, `ha`, `fusion`). This isn't an oversight — FastMCP's `@mcp.tool()` decorator currently has no supported way to register a fully custom JSON Schema (an open, unresolved upstream SDK issue), so the schema is inferred entirely from type hints. Using `Enum`/`Literal` here would generate a `$ref`/`$defs`-based schema with a separate, real, open compatibility bug that gets at least one real MCP client to reject the tool outright. A plain string with the valid values documented in the docstring sidesteps that specific bug, at the honest cost of losing schema-level enforcement — an invalid `source` value is now only caught by Mnemolis's own routing logic, not at the protocol layer.

## A real difference worth knowing about

MCP's `search` tool calls `route()`, the simpler, backward-compatible wrapper that returns just the result string — not `route_with_source()`, which is what the REST API's `/search` endpoint uses to also report `source_used` (including whether a [fallback](Routing#fallback--when-a-source-comes-back-empty) occurred). This means an MCP client gets the plain answer text, the same content a REST caller would get, but **never** learns which source actually answered, or whether a fallback happened along the way. If you need that metadata, you need the REST API — MCP's contract is intentionally just "ask a question, get an answer," with no provenance attached.

**Errors come back as plain text, not an MCP protocol-level error.** If something genuinely goes wrong, the tool returns a normal, successful response whose content happens to start with `"Error: ..."` rather than raising `ToolError` or setting an MCP-level error flag. This is a deliberate choice, not an oversight — every source backing Mnemolis already returns a descriptive failure string instead of raising for expected, recoverable problems (a misconfigured source, an unreachable backend), and the MCP tool is a thin wrapper around that same `route()` call, so it inherits that same contract. If you're building automation against this tool, check the response text itself rather than relying on the call "failing" in the protocol sense.

## How it's actually transported

MCP runs over **Streamable HTTP**, mounted at `/mcp` on the main FastAPI app as a sub-application — shares the same container, port, and network exposure as the REST API, no separate process to manage.

This wasn't always the case — Mnemolis originally used SSE transport, until an external community-run audit flagged a private-API pattern in it, prompting a full migration to Streamable HTTP. The migration itself surfaced a real upstream bug in how `FastMCP.streamable_http_app()` caches its session manager, found and fixed before it ever shipped — and the very first real client connection attempted right after surfaced two more bugs (a doubled endpoint path, a real LAN-connection rejection) that no in-process test could have caught. Both are fixed; the URL below has been correct and reachable over a real network since. See [The MCP Transport Migration](The-MCP-Transport-Migration) for the full history.

## Connecting a client

**Claude Desktop** — add this to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mnemolis": {
      "url": "http://your-host-ip:8888/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Any other MCP client** — point it at the same Streamable HTTP endpoint, `http://your-host-ip:8888/mcp`.

## Why one tool instead of several

It would be possible to expose `search_kiwix`, `search_weather`, `search_news`, and so on as separate MCP tools, letting the calling model pick directly. Mnemolis deliberately doesn't do this — the entire point of [Routing](Routing) is that Mnemolis itself is better positioned to decide which source(s) actually apply than a general-purpose model guessing from tool names alone, especially once [Query Decomposition](Query-Decomposition) and [Fusion](Fusion) are involved. A single `search` tool keeps that decision where it belongs.

This is also exactly the reasoning behind the [Open WebUI System Prompt Guide](Open-WebUI-System-Prompt-Guide) — the real, observed failure mode for tool-calling models isn't picking the wrong tool, it's *pre-splitting* a compound question into multiple narrow calls (or just answering part of it) before Mnemolis's own decomposition logic ever gets a chance to run on the full, original question.
