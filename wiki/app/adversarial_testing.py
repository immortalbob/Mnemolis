"""
Mnemolis Adversarial Self-Testing
Periodically generates structurally-novel queries via combinatorial mutation
over the router's own real ingredient vocabulary, runs them through the real
production pipeline, and flags structural anomalies for human review.

See wiki/Adversarial-Self-Testing.md and the design doc this module
implements for the full rationale. The short version, since it's the single
most load-bearing constraint on everything in this file:

NOTHING HERE EVER JUDGES WHETHER A RESPONSE WAS CORRECT. An LLM-as-judge
approach to this exact task shape (generate a test input AND an expected
answer, then trust the LLM's own judgment) was measured at 6.3% precision in
real research (Liu et al. 2024, arxiv.org/html/2404.10304v1) — 93.7% of
"failures" were the judge's own invented expected-answer being wrong, not
the system under test. This module instead checks Mnemolis's own documented,
stated behavioral guarantees (does a discourse-framing query include kiwix
the way the README says it will; does a query built from N intents produce
something close to N decomposed parts) against what the real pipeline
actually did — a fundamentally different, reliable kind of check than "is
this answer right," requiring no ground truth and no human-replacement
judgment call from a model.

Generation is pure-Python combinatorics over real, already-existing
vocabulary lists (router.INTENT_MAP, router._CONJUNCTIONS,
router._NOSPLIT_PATTERNS, kiwix.DISCOURSE_FRAMING_PATTERNS) plus a small
hardcoded seed corpus of proper-noun pairs and conditional phrases — never
an LLM call per generated query. This mirrors the one part of the AID paper
(the same source above) directly reusable here: generate a script/resource
once, run it many times, rather than paying an LLM call per test case.

    compared header count almost exactly against intended count.

    Found via real production data on MiniDock, not theoretical: that
    earlier version flagged "5 intended, 3 headers found" as a
    part_count_mismatch — traced directly and confirmed this was a
    FALSE POSITIVE, not a real bug. Decomposition produced all 5
    correct parts, every part resolved to the correct source, and
    route_with_source() correctly and intentionally dropped 2 of the 5
    sub-query results because they came back genuinely empty (see its
    own `if not _looks_empty(sub_result): parts.append(...)` —
    deliberate, correct behavior; nobody wants an answer cluttered with
    empty sections). By the time this check sees the final merged
    result string, there is NO trace anywhere of how many sub-queries
    were tried and legitimately came back empty versus how many
    results were silently lost to a real bug — that information is
    gone before _merge_decomposed_parts() is ever called, and this
    check has no way to recover it without re-running every sub-query's
    real backend call a second time, which would double real load on
    every single test cycle just to validate the check itself.

    Given that real, structural blind spot, an exact-count comparison
    fundamentally cannot distinguish "2 of 5 random, unrelated topics
    legitimately had nothing to report" from "2 of 5 results vanished
    due to a bug" — both produce an identical signature. What it CAN
    still meaningfully catch: the original bug 5 itself was a global
    veto that collapsed an entire multi-intent query down to a single
    un-split string — n_headers of 0 or 1 against 4+ intended sources,
    not a partial 2-of-5 gap. "Fewer than half survived" is loose
    enough to never fire on ordinary empty-result variance across this

    Wraps the route_with_source() call in router.suppress_cache_writes()

    routing/fallback/fusion pipeline (the entire point of this feature)
    without writing into cache.json or routing_cache.json — the real,

    directly, before this fix: route_with_source() writes to both files
    as an unconditional side effect of any successful query, synthetic or
    not, since caching happens deep inside _resolve_single_source() and
    _llm_detect()/_llm_pick_fusion_sources(), several calls below
    anything this function controls directly. See router.py's own
    module-level comment next to _SUPPRESS_CACHE_WRITES for the full

    Returns a small summary dict so POST /adversarial/trigger has

    registration time in main.py's lifespan — defense in depth, so a
    direct call (e.g. POST /adversarial/trigger, or a future caller)
