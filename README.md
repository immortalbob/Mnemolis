# Mnemolis

A unified local knowledge search API for self-hosted homelabs. Mnemolis runs as a Docker container on your internal network and routes queries to the appropriate backend — offline knowledge, weather forecast, RSS news, live web search, service monitoring, or multiple sources concurrently — via a single endpoint.

Exposes both a **REST API** and an **MCP server** so any client can connect to it.

Fusion queries all specified sources concurrently, filters empty or failed results, and merges the remainder with source attribution headers. If only one source returns results, it is returned directly without headers.

## Integrations

| Client | Protocol | How |
|--------|----------|-----|
| [Open WebUI](mnemolis_tool.py) | REST | Lightweight tool that POSTs to `/search` |
| [MiniSearch Intents](https://github.com/immortalbob/minisearch_intents) | REST | Native HA LLM API integration |
| Any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) | MCP/SSE | Connect to `http://your-host:8888/mcp/sse` |

## Sources

| Source | Backend | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `kiwix` | [Kiwix](https://www.kiwix.org/) | Offline knowledge base — Wikipedia, Stack Exchange, iFixit, FreeCodeCamp, DevDocs |
| `forecast` | [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) | 3-day weather forecast, no API key required |
| `news` | [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.github.io/FreshRSS/) | Recent articles from your RSS feeds via GReader API |
| `web` | [SearXNG](https://searxng.github.io/searxng/) | Live web search via your local SearXNG instance |
| `uptime` | [Uptime Kuma](https://uptime.kuma.pet/) | Service monitor status — reports any down services |
| `ha` | [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) | Entity state summaries — lights, locks, sensors, motion, batteries, power |
| `fusion` | — | Query multiple sources concurrently and merge results |
| `auto` | — | Mnemolis detects intent and picks the best source |

## Requirements

- Docker + Docker Compose
- A Docker network for container communication (default: `mnemo-net`)
- One or more of the supported backends running and reachable on the same network

## Quick Start

### Full stack (recommended)

The repo includes an example compose file and SearXNG config to get all services running together:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/immortalbob/Mnemolis
cd Mnemolis

# Create the shared network if it doesn't exist
docker network create mnemo-net

# Copy and edit the example compose file
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
# Fill in credentials, your coordinates, and secret_key in searxng/settings.yml

docker compose up -d
```

### What's not in the full stack
The example compose intentionally excludes Home Assistant, your LLM backend, and Uptime Kuma — these are typically long-running services with their own existing setup.

If you're running any of these in Docker and want them reachable by Mnemolis, connect them to `mnemo-net`:

```bash
docker network connect mnemo-net ollama
docker network connect mnemo-net homeassistant
```

### Mnemolis only

If you already have the backends running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/immortalbob/Mnemolis
cd Mnemolis
# Edit docker-compose.yml with your settings
docker compose up -d
```

Hit `http://your-host:8888/health` to confirm it's running.
Full API docs at `http://your-host:8888/docs`.

## Configuration

All settings are passed as environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `KIWIX_URL` | Kiwix container URL | `http://kiwix:8080` |
| `FRESHRSS_URL` | FreshRSS container URL | `http://freshrss` |
| `FRESHRSS_USER` | FreshRSS username | |
| `FRESHRSS_API_PASSWORD` | FreshRSS API password | |
| `FRESHRSS_MAX_ARTICLES` | Max articles to fetch | `10` |
| `SEARXNG_URL` | SearXNG container URL | `http://searxng:8080` |
| `FORECAST_LATITUDE` | Forecast location latitude | `35.1894` |
| `FORECAST_LONGITUDE` | Forecast location longitude | `-114.0530` |
| `FORECAST_LOCATION_NAME` | Human-readable location name | `Kingman, Arizona` |
| `FORECAST_TIMEZONE` | Timezone for forecast times | `America/Phoenix` |
| `UPTIME_KUMA_URL` | Uptime Kuma URL | _(blank — disables uptime source)_ |
| `UPTIME_KUMA_USERNAME` | Uptime Kuma username | |
| `UPTIME_KUMA_PASSWORD` | Uptime Kuma password | |
| `HA_URL` | Home Assistant URL | _(blank — disables HA source)_ |
| `HA_TOKEN` | Home Assistant long-lived access token | |
| `LLM_URL` | LLM backend URL for intelligent routing | _(blank — disables LLM routing)_ |
| `LLM_MODEL` | Model to use for source and book selection | `qwen3:8b` |
| `LLM_API_TYPE` | API format: `ollama` or `openai` | `ollama` |

### FreshRSS API setup
1. Enable API access: **Administration → Authentication → Allow API access**
2. Set an API password: **Profile → API password**
3. Use that password for `FRESHRSS_API_PASSWORD` (it's separate from your login password)

### SearXNG JSON format
Mnemolis queries SearXNG's JSON API. The included `searxng/settings.yml` already has this enabled. If you're using an existing SearXNG instance, make sure `json` is in your formats list:

```yaml
search:
  formats:
    - html
    - json
```

Also generate a unique `secret_key` in `searxng/settings.yml`:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### LLM-assisted routing
Mnemolis uses a local LLM backend in three ways:

1. **Source selection** — when `auto` is used and no keyword matches, the LLM picks the best source based on the query. For complex multi-topic queries it returns multiple sources, triggering fusion automatically.
2. **Book selection** — once routed to Kiwix, the LLM picks the best 1-2 ZIM books from your catalog for the query
3. **Fusion source selection** — when `fusion` is used without specifying sources, the LLM picks the best 2-3 sources for the query

**Auto-fusion escalation** — `source="auto"` now detects multi-topic queries at the keyword level too. If a query matches triggers from multiple sources (e.g. "weather" + "services up"), fusion is triggered automatically without an LLM call.

Routing decisions are cached for 1 hour so repeated queries skip the LLM call entirely.

**Supported backends** via `LLM_API_TYPE`:
- `ollama` — Ollama native API (default)
- `openai` — OpenAI-compatible API (llama-server, LM Studio, etc.)

The book list is built dynamically from your Kiwix catalog at startup. To force a refresh after adding ZIMs:

```bash
curl -X POST http://your-host:8888/catalog/refresh
```

If `LLM_URL` is left blank, Mnemolis falls back to keyword-based routing and Wikipedia for all Kiwix queries.

### Home Assistant setup
Generate a long-lived access token in Home Assistant:
1. Go to your **Profile** (click your username in the sidebar)
2. Scroll to **Long-lived access tokens**
3. Click **Create Token**, give it a name, copy the token
4. Set `HA_URL` to your HA instance URL (e.g. `http://192.168.3.6:8123`)
5. Set `HA_TOKEN` to the generated token

The `ha` source handles analytical queries that go beyond HA's built-in single-entity intent handling:
- **"house status summary"** — lights, locks, sensors, motion, batteries
- **"indoor air quality"** — CO2, temperature, humidity from indoor sensors
- **"security status"** — locks, doors, recent motion with time-ago
- **"battery status"** — all device battery levels
- **"outdoor conditions"** — weather station sensors
- **"how much power am I using"** — current and historical consumption

The `ha` source also participates in fusion — "house status and what's the weather" automatically fuses `ha` + `forecast`.

## REST API

### `POST /search`

Single source:

```json
{
  "query": "what is molybdenum",
  "source": "auto"
}
```

Fusion — LLM picks sources automatically:

```json
{
  "query": "what is happening with the space program lately",
  "source": "fusion"
}
```

Fusion — explicit source list:

```json
{
  "query": "what is happening with the space program lately",
  "source": "fusion",
  "fusion_sources": ["kiwix", "web", "news"]
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "query": "what is molybdenum",
  "source_used": "kiwix",
  "result": "# Molybdenum\nSource: wikipedia_en_all_maxi_2026-02\n\n...",
  "success": true,
  "cached": false,
  "error": null
}
```

### `GET /sources`
Returns the list of available sources.

### `GET /health`
Returns status, number of Kiwix books loaded, cache entry count, and connectivity status for every configured source.

### `GET /catalog`
Lists all books currently loaded from the Kiwix OPDS catalog.

### `POST /catalog/refresh`
Forces a re-scan of the Kiwix catalog without restarting the container.

### `GET /cache`
Shows all current result cache entries with age and remaining TTL.

### `POST /cache/clear`
Clears all result cache entries from memory and disk.

### `GET /cache/routing`
Shows all current routing cache entries — source and Kiwix book selection decisions cached to avoid redundant LLM calls.

### `POST /cache/routing/clear`
Clears all routing cache entries from memory and disk.

### `GET /logs`
Returns recent query log entries — timestamp, query, source used, cached flag, success, and latency in milliseconds. Optional `?limit=N` parameter (default 50).

### `POST /logs/clear`
Clears all query log entries.

## Caching

Mnemolis caches results in memory and persists them to disk so the cache survives container restarts. TTLs are set per source:

| Source | TTL |
|--------|-----|
| `kiwix` | 24 hours |
| `web` | 1 hour |
| `fusion` | 30 minutes |
| `forecast` | 30 minutes |
| `news` | 15 minutes |
| `uptime` | 1 minute |
| `ha` | 30 seconds |

Routing decisions (which source, Kiwix books, and fusion source sets to use) are cached separately for 1 hour.

## MCP

Mnemolis exposes an MCP server via SSE at `/mcp/sse` on the same port as the REST API.

### Connecting Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mnemolis": {
      "url": "http://your-host-ip:8888/mcp/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### Connecting any MCP client

SSE endpoint: `http://your-host-ip:8888/mcp/sse`

The MCP server exposes a single `search` tool with the same interface as the REST API, including `fusion_sources` support.

## Kiwix ZIM files

Download ZIM files from [library.kiwix.org](https://library.kiwix.org) and place them in `./data/kiwix/`. The example compose mounts this directory into the Kiwix container automatically.

Popular ZIMs for a homelab stack:
- `wikipedia_en_all_maxi` — full English Wikipedia
- `unix.stackexchange.com_en_all` — Unix & Linux Stack Exchange
- `raspberrypi.stackexchange.com_en_all` — Raspberry Pi Stack Exchange
- `ifixit_en_all` — iFixit repair guides
- `freecodecamp_en_all` — FreeCodeCamp
- `devdocs_en_python` — Python DevDocs

## Adding a New Source

1. Create `app/sources/your_source.py` with a `search(query: str) -> str` function
2. Add any config vars to `app/config.py` and `docker-compose.yml`
3. Import and register it in `app/router.py` — add to `SOURCE_MAP`, `INTENT_MAP`, `SOURCE_DESCRIPTIONS`, and `CACHE_TTL`
4. Rebuild: `docker compose up -d --build`

The new source is automatically available via both REST and MCP — and immediately fusable with any other source.

## Running Tests

```bash
docker exec mnemolis python3 -m pytest /app/tests/ -v
```

215 tests covering intent routing, multi-keyword fusion escalation, cache logic, routing cache, Kiwix scoring and stemming, definitional query detection, search term cleaning, FreshRSS article filtering, all source modules via mocking, fusion behavior, and Home Assistant entity filtering.

## Philosophy

Local-first, privacy-preserving, subscription-free. Mnemolis is designed for homelabs where the data stays home. Open-Meteo is the only external network call — every other source (Kiwix, FreshRSS, SearXNG, Uptime Kuma, Home Assistant) runs on your own infrastructure.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. New source modules are the easiest contribution — drop a file in `sources/`, register it in the router, done. The new source is immediately available via REST, MCP, and fusion with no additional work.

### Proposed modules

Looking for contributors interested in building out additional sources:

- **Jellyfin** — search local media library by title, genre, or actor
- **Paperless-ngx** — search scanned documents and OCR'd content
- **Mealie** — search self-hosted recipe library
- **Grocy** — query pantry inventory, shopping list, or expiring items
- **Calibre** — search local ebook library
- **Navidrome** — search self-hosted music library by artist, album, or track
- **Immich** — search local photo library by date, album, or description

Each source only needs a single `search(query: str) -> str` function. See any existing file in `app/sources/` as a reference.
