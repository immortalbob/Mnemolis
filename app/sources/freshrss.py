# Found via a deliberate complexity-investigation pass: the original
# set only handled formal/grammatical filler ("the", "is", "about"),
# missing the common REQUEST verbs and modifiers that show up in how
# people actually phrase a general news ask out loud — "tell me the
# news", "give me the headlines", "any news today" all failed to be
# recognized as general queries, since "tell"/"give"/"any"/"today"
# weren't stop words and survived to make `meaningful` a non-subset of
# _GENERAL_QUERIES. A direct test against 9 realistic phrasings found 9
# of 9 failing before this fix. Also added "whats" (no apostrophe) —
# _GENERAL_QUERIES already handled both apostrophe forms for the full
# phrase ("what's happening" / "whats happening"), but the bare
# contracted word itself was never a recognized stop word on its own,
# so "whats new" still failed even after the verb additions above.
