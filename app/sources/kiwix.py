# the whole matched PHRASE (not just adding individual words to

    of brand name matches. The original query is kept separately for
    scoring so context is preserved there.

    Contractions are normalized before stop-word matching — "what's"
    otherwise survives as "what'" (a stray apostrophe left over after
    stemming strips the trailing "s"), which never matches the "what"
    stop word and pollutes the search term with leftover punctuation.
