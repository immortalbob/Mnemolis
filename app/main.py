    Also rebuilds and re-mounts the MCP Streamable HTTP app fresh on every
    startup, then enters its lifespan — a real, currently-open issue
    across the broader MCP/FastMCP ecosystem (not specific to how
    Mnemolis is built) made this more involved than a simple "enter the
    sub-app's lifespan too":

    `FastMCP.streamable_http_app()` lazily creates ONE session manager
    and caches it on the FastMCP instance — calling it again still
    returns the same cached manager wrapped in a NEW Starlette app, but
    `StreamableHTTPSessionManager.run()` can only ever be entered once
    per instance. A module-level `mcp_app` built once at import time
    means every independent app lifecycle (every container restart in
    production; every `with TestClient(app) as client:` block in this
    test suite) tries to re-run the same already-exhausted session
    manager, raising a hard RuntimeError on the second attempt — this
    surfaced as several `test_security.py` tests failing only when run
    after `test_main.py`, since both files spin up their own TestClient
    against the same imported `app`.

    Verified the first attempt at fixing this was genuinely incomplete:
    resetting `mcp._session_manager` to None before calling
    `streamable_http_app()` again does create a fresh session manager,
    but the ALREADY-MOUNTED route from module-import time still holds a
    reference to the OLD app object's lifespan closure and request
    handler — resetting the FastMCP instance's cached attribute doesn't
    retroactively change what an already-built Starlette app's router
    closure points to. The real fix rebuilds the app fresh AND finds the
    actual `/mcp` Mount route in app.router.routes to reassign its `.app`
    reference, so the object whose lifespan gets entered is genuinely the
    same object that serves real requests during that lifecycle — not
    two different objects that happen to share an FastMCP instance.

        # queries only," but the SQL below has no cached filter at all
        # and never did. Verified precisely which behavior is actually
        # more useful before deciding which one was wrong: constructing
        # a realistic two-source comparison (one genuinely slow,
        # network-bound source; one genuinely fast, local one) showed
        # that a TRUE warm-only average would mask almost all of the
        # real difference between them (15ms vs 12ms in the test, vs.
        # a real, honest 3000ms vs 80ms cold-only difference) — cache
        # hits are fast regardless of source, so warm-only averaging
        # tells you almost nothing about which source is actually
        # expensive when it has to do real work. The combined number
        # below at least reflects real, paid latency, even though it's
        # sensitive to cache-hit ratio. A cold-only breakdown would be
        # the genuinely most diagnostic version of this metric, but
        # that's a real, deliberate scope decision for a future change,
