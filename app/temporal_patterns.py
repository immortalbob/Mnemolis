"""
Mnemolis Cross-Source Temporal Pattern Detection

A background job, on the same apscheduler infrastructure the snapshot
engine and adversarial self-testing already run on, that looks for
reliable timing relationships between structured event types — does a
front-door lock event reliably precede a motion event within some lag
window, does an HA event reliably precede a service outage — and
reports anything that survives a real statistical bar as a candidate,
never a causal claim.

See the design doc and wiki/Cross-Source-Temporal-Pattern-Detection.md
for the full rationale. The short version, since it's the single most
load-bearing constraint on everything in this file:

CORRELATION FOUND ONCE, EVEN STATISTICALLY CORRECTED, IS NOT THE SAME
THING AS A VALIDATED PATTERN, AND NEITHER IS CAUSATION. Real, peer-
reviewed temporal pattern-mining methods show double-digit false-
positive rates at data volumes far above what Mnemolis will ever
realistically see (Raajay, Sastry, Unnikrishnan 2010,
arxiv.org/pdf/1006.1543 — their own best-performing method, explicitly
engineered to bound false positives, still showed 15-48% false-positive
rates at 50k-200k events; Mnemolis's real event volume in any practical
window is tens to low hundreds). Testing many (event type A, event type
B, lag bucket) combinations without correction produces spurious
"discoveries" as a mathematical certainty, independent of data quality
(arxiv.org/pdf/1504.06896 — 4 uncorrected hypotheses alone produced a
15% false-positive rate, matching 1 - 0.95^4 almost exactly). Every
design decision below — the fixed lag window, the per-comparison
Bonferroni correction, the hard minimum-occurrence floor, the
mandatory out-of-sample re-validation before anything is called
"confirmed" — exists to keep this feature honest about what it can
and cannot actually claim, not to make it look more rigorous than it
is.

Scope, deliberately narrow for this first version: `ha`-internal event
pairs (lock/door/battery transitions against each other) and `ha`-to-
coarse-`uptime` pairs (any ha event against a source-level uptime
outage/recovery signal). `forecast` and `news` event extraction is
explicitly deferred — neither source's current snapshot shape
(free-text, not structured) supports clean event typing without new
groundwork that's out of scope here. See the design doc section 4 for
the full reasoning on why this scope line was drawn where it was.
