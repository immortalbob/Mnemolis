# frequent of any source) only retained 9.6 real hours of data under
# that shared constant — a real query like "what changed with my
# services since yesterday" (48h) or "any outages this week" (168h)
# would silently return an incomplete picture, missing 80%+ of the

# contrast, was retaining 288 real HOURS (12 days) under the same
# shared constant — far more than ever needed, while `uptime` had far
# less than the system's own documented features required.

# Scaled per-source from each source's real interval so every source

    Report each background snapshot job's health by comparing its most
    recent successful snapshot timestamp against its expected interval.

    Found via real review, not a reported failure: every snapshot job
    (snapshot_uptime, snapshot_forecast, snapshot_news, snapshot_ha)
    already catches its own exceptions and just logs a warning — meaning
    a job that started failing on every single run would never crash,
    never stop the scheduler, and produce zero externally visible signal
    beyond a log line nobody is necessarily watching. The scheduler
    object itself also has no external visibility at all (it's a local
    variable inside main.py's lifespan context manager, never exposed to
    any endpoint) — so there was previously no way to ask "is the
    background scheduler actually still running and succeeding" without
    reading raw application logs.

    Uses a configurable grace multiplier (default 3x) on each job's
    interval before considering it stale — generous enough to absorb
    normal jitter (job execution time, a slightly delayed scheduler
    start), tight enough to catch a genuinely stuck job within a
    reasonable window at the default (e.g. the 60-minute news job is
    flagged after ~3 hours of silence, not days). Found hardcoded via a
