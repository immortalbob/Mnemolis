LLM client helper — supports both Ollama native API and OpenAI-compatible API.

Supported backends via LLM_API_TYPE:
  "ollama"  — Ollama native /api/generate (default)
  "openai"  — OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions (llama-server, LM Studio, etc.)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Persistent HTTP session — connection reuse across every LLM call
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Found while investigating why singleflight (v3.50.13) didn't move `auto`'s
# cold-path p99 plateau, despite directly confirming the deduplication
# mechanism itself works in isolation: every single call into this module
# used the bare `requests.post()` module function, never a `requests.Session`
# — meaning every LLM call (book selection, source routing, fusion-source
# selection, disambiguation candidates) opened a brand-new TCP connection to
# the LLM backend and tore it down again immediately after, on every single
# call, with zero reuse. This is the identical class of bug
# `uptime_kuma.py`'s own connection used to have (a fresh Socket.IO
# connect+login cycle on every call) before that was found and fixed — see
# wiki/Caching.md's "Why uptime's connection is persistent..." section and
# wiki/The-Benchmark-Investigation-Log.md's Thread 1 for the full history of
# that fix and how long it took to actually find, despite looking like a
# caching problem at first.
#
# This module's case is structurally simpler than Uptime Kuma's — there's no
# login/session state to track and no liveness check needed (a plain HTTP
# connection pool has no equivalent of "logged in vs not"; `requests`' own
# adapter already transparently opens a fresh connection if a pooled one has
# gone stale or dead), so a single, eagerly-created module-level `Session`
# is sufficient. requests.Session() is genuinely safe for concurrent READ-
# ONLY use across threads — confirmed against the library maintainers' own
# stated position (a real psf/requests GitHub issue on this exact question),
# which is more precise than the library's own homepage "thread-safe" bullet
# alone suggests: the underlying urllib3 connection pool is thread-safe per
# individual request, but the Session object's own shared mutable state
# (headers, cookies) is NOT safe under concurrent MUTATION — one thread
# changing session.headers while another reads it is the real, documented
# risk, not concurrent requests through an unmodified session. Verified this
# module's actual usage never crosses that line: grep-confirmed `_session`
# is only ever read from (`.post()`) after the two `.mount()` calls at
# import time below, never mutated again from anywhere. Mnemolis's own
# concurrent request model (FastAPI's /search route is synchronous, so
# Starlette already runs real concurrent requests on its own thread pool)
# makes this the actual, live concurrency shape this needs to be safe
# under, not a theoretical one.
#
# Plain module-level singleton, not a lazy-init-with-lock accessor like
# `uptime_kuma.get_connection()` — Session() construction does no I/O at
# all (it just builds an empty connection-pool adapter), so there's no
# "first caller pays a real connection cost" race to guard against the way
# Uptime Kuma's actual login call has.
#
# Pool size explicitly set via settings.llm_connection_pool_size rather
# than left at requests' own library default (10) — see that setting's
# own comment in app/config.py for the real concurrency numbers
# (Starlette's 40-thread default limiter; a 20-concurrent-user Locust
# benchmark) behind the chosen size. Mounted on both schemes since
# LLM_URL could plausibly be configured with either, even though every
# real deployment this project documents uses plain http://.

    qwen3:8b's own template-based thinking-control logic, which
    correctly respects think:false regardless of nesting. Worth
    re-verifying this placement still matters (or doesn't) if this
