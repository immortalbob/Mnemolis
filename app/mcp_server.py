Mnemolis MCP Server
Exposes Mnemolis as an MCP tool server via Streamable HTTP transport.
Mounted at /mcp by the FastAPI app in main.py.

Migrated from the low-level Server class + manual SSE transport wiring to
FastMCP + Streamable HTTP. Two real, independent reasons for this:

1. SSE is explicitly being superseded by Streamable HTTP across the MCP
   ecosystem — official FastMCP docs state "SSE exists only for backward
   compatibility and shouldn't be used in new projects." Patching the old
   transport would have meant polishing something already on its way out.

2. The old implementation manually accessed `request._send`, a private
   Starlette attribute, while wiring up SseServerTransport by hand. That
   pattern does match the official SDK's own low-level reference examples
   (it's not a Mnemolis-specific shortcut), but FastMCP's high-level
   `streamable_http_app()` avoids the need for any application code to
   touch private Starlette internals at all — that access still happens
   inside the SDK, but it's the SDK's concern to manage, not ours.

A real, deliberate tradeoff made during this migration: the tool's
`source` parameter is typed as a plain `str`, not an `Enum` or `Literal`,
even though the original implementation had a real JSON Schema `enum`
constraint. This is NOT an oversight — FastMCP's `@mcp.tool()` decorator
currently has no supported way to register a fully custom inputSchema
(open upstream issue, no workaround as of this writing), so the schema is
inferred entirely from type hints. Using Enum/Literal here would generate
a `$ref`/`$defs`-based schema that has an open, real compatibility bug
with at least one real client (a $ref resolution failure rejecting the
tool entirely). A plain `str` with the valid values documented in the
docstring sidesteps that specific bug class, at the real cost of losing
schema-level enum enforcement — invalid values are now only caught by
Mnemolis's own routing logic, not at the MCP protocol layer. Worth
revisiting if/when the upstream SDK issue is resolved.
A real, separate, more serious concern found during research but NOT
something this migration could fix on Mnemolis's side: an open upstream
issue (modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk#737) describes a race condition
where the StreamableHTTPSessionManager can report "shutting down"
immediately after a request starts, before the response is fully
streamed — causing empty/broken responses under certain timing
conditions. This is a genuine, currently-unresolved concern with the
underlying transport itself, not something our own session-manager-reset
fix touches. Worth monitoring for real-world reports of truncated MCP
responses; if seen, check that upstream issue for a resolution before
assuming it's a Mnemolis-side bug.
A second real bug found via actual MCP client testing (MCP Inspector),
not caught by the test suite at all: FastMCP's `transport_security`
defaults to DNS-rebinding protection that only allows the `Host` header
to be `127.0.0.1`/`localhost`/`::1` — auto-enabled specifically because
FastMCP's own `host` constructor parameter defaults to `127.0.0.1`. Since
Mnemolis is explicitly designed to be reached over a real LAN (the whole
point of running it as a homelab service), every real-network connection
attempt was being rejected with "Invalid Host header" before ever
reaching the actual tool logic. `TestClient`-based tests never caught
this because TestClient addresses the app as `testserver` internally,
never exercising real Host-header validation at all — this is exactly
the kind of gap real client testing exists to catch. Fixed by explicitly
disabling DNS-rebinding protection via `transport_security`, since
Mnemolis already assumes a trusted local network (see the README's API
key authentication section for the actual, intended trust model).

    """
    Build (or rebuild) the Streamable HTTP ASGI app, with a fresh session
    manager each time this is called.

    A real, genuine bug found while migrating off the old SSE transport:
    `FastMCP.streamable_http_app()` lazily creates ONE session manager and
    caches it on the FastMCP instance (`if self._session_manager is None`)
    — calling streamable_http_app() again still reuses that same cached
    manager. StreamableHTTPSessionManager.run() can only be entered once
    per instance, ever; entering it a second time raises a hard
    RuntimeError. The old SSE transport had no equivalent restriction.

    This is a real, currently-open issue across the broader MCP/FastMCP
    ecosystem, not something specific to how Mnemolis is built — multiple
    independent reports describe the exact same RuntimeError, both in
    test suites using TestClient (each `with TestClient(app) as client:`
    re-runs the full app lifespan from scratch) and in real production
    deployments under certain conditions (concurrent startup, serverless
    cold starts). Resetting `mcp._session_manager` to None before each
    call to `streamable_http_app()` forces a fresh session manager to be
    created, which is the actual root cause fix rather than a narrow
    workaround — it directly addresses why .run() could only be called
    once (a stale cached reference reused across what should be
    independent app lifecycles), mirroring how the snapshot scheduler in
    main.py's lifespan is already freshly created on every startup rather
    than reused as a module-level singleton.

    Verified directly: three consecutive simulated app lifecycles
    (entering and exiting this app's lifespan context) all completed
    cleanly with this reset in place, where they previously failed on the
    second lifecycle without it.
