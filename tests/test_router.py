    AFTER the length gate, not before.

    Real, observed effect: "everyone keeps talking about black holes,
    and rss" never decomposed into ["...black holes,", "rss"] — it
    stayed one unsplit string, sent whole to fusion, with "rss" riding
    along as real, counted noise into kiwix's own search API call and
    scoring for a query that should only ever be about black holes.
    Confirmed and traced directly against a live MiniDock result: an
    unrelated Stack Exchange thread and an unrelated podcast Wikipedia
    article both outscored the real Black Hole article.

    Fixed by reordering _filter_meaningful() so the colloquial-phrase
    and INTENT_MAP-keyword checks run BEFORE the length<=3 gate — once
    decomposition correctly isolates "rss" into its own clause, it
    routes to `news` independently, and kiwix never receives it as
    part of its own search text at all. This closes the actual root
    cause (decomposition failing to split a genuinely independent
    clause) rather than trying to make kiwix's scoring defensively
    robust against noise it should never have received in the first
    place — a real, structural fix, not a narrower patch.

    "what is the weather and if the back door is unlocked, let me know"

    The first implementation of this fix recursed on the ORIGINAL

    a manual _depth counter meant to prevent runaway recursion. That
    introduced a real, found-via-testing bug: the depth incremented
    before the conditional was actually consumed, so the recursive
    call's own necessary re-detection of the very same conditional was
    blocked by the counter meant to guard against recursion that was
    never actually possible in the first place. Fixed by extracting the
    condition/consequence directly in the loop (mirroring exactly how
    the top-level handler already works) and recursing on the
    already-extracted CONDITION text only — which essentially never
