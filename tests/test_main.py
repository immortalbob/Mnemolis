    Regression coverage for a real bug found via production debugging —
    the root logger defaulted to WARNING with no attached handler, which

    codebase (decomposition splits, disambiguation candidates, article
    selection, snapshot jobs, etc). Only uvicorn's own access logger (a
    separate logger with its own handler) was ever visible in container
    logs, making it look like the app was processing requests with zero
    diagnostic output — when in fact the info logs were firing, just
    never reaching any output destination.

    These tests call logging.basicConfig() directly with the same
    arguments app/main.py uses, rather than relying on `import app.main`
    to trigger it — app.main is already cached in sys.modules by the
    time these tests run (the `client` fixture above imports it first),
    so a second `import app.main` is a no-op and never re-executes the
    module-level basicConfig() call. Testing the actual configuration
    logic directly avoids depending on Python's one-time import behavior.

    alongside the MCP_MOUNT_PATH constant — found via a deliberate
    function-by-function read: the path used to match against was a bare
    "/mcp" string literal, independently typed in two places (here and at
    the real app.mount() call), with nothing enforcing the two ever
    agreed. If they silently drifted apart, the matching loop would find
    no route, silently leave the stale module-import-time mcp_app

    entered once" bug the surrounding fix exists to prevent — not at
