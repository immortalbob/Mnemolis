"""
Mnemolis Load Testing — Locust
Tests realistic query patterns across all sources under concurrent load.

For a genuine cold-cache run, clear both caches first — neither
"cold cache" nor anything else here happens automatically:
    curl -X POST http://your-mnemolis-host:8888/cache/clear
    curl -X POST http://your-mnemolis-host:8888/cache/routing/clear

Run:
    locust -f tests/locustfile.py --host http://192.168.1.50:8888

Replace 192.168.1.50 with your actual Mnemolis host's real IP or
hostname — not a placeholder. --host silently accepts anything that
looks like a URL, so a leftover example value doesn't fail loudly; it
fails much later as a DNS error ("Temporary failure in name
resolution") on every single request, which doesn't obviously point
back to the --host flag as the cause.

Then open http://localhost:8089 and configure:
    - Users: 10
    - Spawn rate: 2
    - Run for 60 seconds

Run the identical command again immediately afterward, without
clearing anything in between, for the warm-cache comparison — the
second run's populated caches are the point.

p95 targets:
    Single source, cache hit:      < 100ms
    Single source, cache miss:     < 4s
    Fusion (2 sources):            < 8s
    10 concurrent users:           < 10% error rate

    # Widened again, 20 -> 40 (v3.50.9), this time correcting TWO real
    # mistakes the v3.50.8 sizing made, not just picking a bigger number:
    #
    # 1. Wrong metric. "Expected number of colliding pool entries" isn't
    #    what predicts the benchmark's actual tail — "fraction of the 20
    #    concurrent users whose first pick collides with someone else's"
    #    is. That fraction declines monotonically with pool size (no
    #    peak to worry about), but it declines SLOWLY: 4 entries -> 99.6%
    #    of users collide, 12 -> 80.9%, 20 -> 62.3%. The v3.50.8 sizing
    #    (8->20) only moved this from 92.1% to 62.3% — a real
    #    improvement on paper, small enough to be invisible against
    #    ordinary single-run noise at this benchmark's sample sizes
    #    (35-49 requests/run for this endpoint).
    #
    # 2. Wrong assumption about collision cost. AUTO_QUERIES's widening
    #    worked great at a SIMILAR nominal collision fraction (55.5% at
    #    24 entries) because most of ITS collisions land on a cheap,
    #    structured source (forecast/news/uptime) — confirmed directly:
    #    only 2 of 24 AUTO_QUERIES entries fall through to kiwix's
    #    expensive LLM book-selection path. The original 20-entry
    #    CONDITIONAL_QUERIES pool was the opposite: 17 of 20 conditions
    #    (85%) fell through to kiwix — confirmed by running every one
    #    through detect_intent() directly, not assumed — meaning a
    #    collision here costs far more per occurrence than a collision
    #    on auto's pool, even at a similar collision RATE. Lower
    #    collision rate alone wasn't going to be enough.
    #
    # This pass fixes both: widened to 40 entries (38.2% collision
    # fraction — chosen LOWER than auto's 55.5%, deliberately, given the
    # higher per-collision cost), AND the 20 new entries below were
    # specifically written to hit ha/uptime/forecast/changes keywords in
    # app/router.py's real INTENT_MAP rather than falling through to
    # kiwix — verified directly against detect_intent() before being
    # added, not assumed from "sounds like it should." Brought the
    # pool's overall kiwix-fallback ratio from 85% down to 42%. Every
    # entry (old and new) still verified against detect_conditional() to
    # confirm a real condition/consequence with an empty remainder.
