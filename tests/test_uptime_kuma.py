    """Regression coverage for the actual root cause traced down behind
    `uptime`'s recurring, unexplained warm-cache tail (v3.50.4, v3.50.6,
    v3.50.7 benchmark runs all showed the identical ~440ms tail value):
    `uptime_kuma_api`'s own `_get_event_data()` pays its `wait_events`
    sleep (default 0.2s) UNCONDITIONALLY every single time it's called,
    even when the awaited data has been sitting there, fully complete,
    since a previous call — confirmed directly against the installed
    library source via a standalone reproduction (not an assumption):
    constructing a mock with `_event_data` already populated and
    calling the real, unpatched `UptimeKumaApi._get_event_data` against
    it still took the full 0.2s.

    Two such unconditional sleeps per `search()` call
    (`get_monitors()` + `get_heartbeats()`) is exactly the ~0.4s
    structural floor that landed at p90+ in every benchmark run to
    date — not lock contention, not server-side variance, a fixed,
    deterministic library cost paid on every genuine cache miss.

    The fix narrows `wait_events` only AFTER a connection's first
    successful data fetch settles — the one call that genuinely needs
    the full, safe wait, per the library's own documented purpose
    (waiting for trailing per-monitor `heartbeatList`/`monitorList`
    push messages right after login). Every later call on the same,
    already-settled persistent connection has nothing structurally
    left to wait for — confirmed directly: `_event_heartbeat()`
    (the steady-state, post-login push handler) appends one complete
    record per call, with no multi-message batching at all.
